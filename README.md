# Color_and_Hairstyle_Recommendation_System

This is an attempt to combine both color analysis model and hairstyle recommendation model under a single platform. The project focuses on building a user-friendly web application that provides personalized style recommendations through two main components:

• Clothing Color Recommendation System

1. Utilizes skin tone data to suggest clothing colors that enhance the user's appearance.
2. Incorporates user inputs (image) for analysis.
   
• Hairstyle Recommendation System
1. Analyzes face shape to suggest suitable hairstyles.
2. Provides options for females.
   
Recommendations can be generated based on a variety of machine learning algorithms, and scalable to potentially incorporate features that could include makeup advice,accessory suggestions, and many others in the future. The system leverages deep learning models, including MobileNetV2 for color analysis and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for hairstyle recommendation.
